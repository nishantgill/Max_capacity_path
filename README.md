# Max_capacity_path

This  will display output on 50 source destination pairs (25 for degree 6 and 25 for degree 1000. Total graphs generated would be 10. Five of each kind(dense and sparse)). It will run all 3 algorithms Â­ Dijkstra_without_heap, Dijkstra_with_heap and KruskalMST on these 10 graphs for these 50 src/dest pairs.
The output will display the random source and destination vertices and will also print the maximum capacity value for destination vertex from the source and additionally will display the time taken by each algorithm, in seconds.
